# NexaStore — Analytics Suite (Analysis • Data Quality Sprint • Strategic Reporting)

## Project Overview
NexaStore is an end-to-end analytics project structured into **three modules**:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the dataset and key patterns
2. **Data Quality Sprint** to assess, prioritize, and address data quality issues using a sprint approach
3. **Strategic Reporting** to translate analytical findings into **KPIs** and decision-ready insights

This repository showcases a structured, business-oriented approach to analytics:
from raw exploration → quality improvement planning → reporting and recommendations.

> Note: Notebooks and deliverables may be written in French (academic context), while the repository structure is designed for clarity and recruiter review.

## Objectives
- Perform an analytical exploration of NexaStore data (distribution, anomalies, trends)
- Identify and document **data quality issues** (missing values, inconsistencies, duplicates, outliers)
- Prioritize fixes using a **sprint planning framework**
- Produce a **strategic report** with actionable KPIs and recommendations

---

## Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Data Quality methods (profiling, rules, validation)
- KPI reporting & business storytelling
- Excel deliverables (planning templates, reporting artifacts)
